# sql-challenge
In this project, I used SQL and DBDatabase to model, engineer, and analyze data. I used DBDatabase to model the data, then I created the tables and set up primary and foriegn keys in pgadmin 4. Finally I used the tables I created to analyze the data through queires.

For anyone who wants to look at my results, the data modeling is in the 'Homework 9 Modeling.png' file. The data engineering is in the 'Homework 9 Engineering.sql' file. The data analysis is in the 'Homework 9 Analysis.sql' file. The data that I used for this project can be found in the 'Starter_Code' folder.
